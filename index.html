      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="text">

          Hi! I am a dedicated Software Validation Engineer & PC Builder who recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree (B.Eng) in Computer
          Engineering (Software Engineering Option) at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) in June 2025. Strong foundation in software validation engineering principles, with additional project experience in machine learning, database systems, and performance optimization using parallel computing. Returning to AMD to further develop validation expertise.<br><br>

          My recent internship provided me the opportunity of working with the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Customer Software Engineering Team as a Stability Operator & Debug Intern. During my 12-month stay, I led the development and maintenance of automated testing pipelines using Python and PowerShell, improving test execution efficiency and system uptime across over 60 reference PC systems. Skilled in troubleshooting hardware/software issues, collaborating with cross-functional QA and DevOps teams, and utilizing tools such as GitHub, Jira, and Confluence for improved intern onboarding. <br><br>

          My experience with leadership positions such being an instructor and second-in-command to my air
          cadet squadron has greatly sharpened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
          The leadership challenges and rigorous training I encountered as a cadet has led me to develop
          innovative side projects that address complex issues in an efficient manner. <br><br>

          My prior work experience, projects, and classes have provided me with expertise in database management,
          algorithm development, and software testing and quality assurance. I am particularly interested in these
          areas, as well as customer engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. As a continuous and
          quick learner, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. <br><br>

          As for my hobbies, I love gaming, PC building/consulting, baking, cooking, music, and all things Formula 1. The whole
          story of how I fell in love with PC building is too long for this section but I love sharing it with people.
          Feel free to check out some recommended PC part lists down below or reach out for a free consultation! <br> <br>
